    in autumn 2025, as the leaves fell and the air turned crisp, teens in Hack
    Club spent 2 months designing and making their own personal website, as part
    of the
    <a href="https://page.hackclub.com" target="_blank"
      >personal site ysws event</a
    >. these sites gave an outlet for them to showcase themselves, their hobbies
    and their interests to the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    this webring is a collection of those personal websites, so people (like
    you!!) can go explore, find new friends, and get inspiration for making your
    own personal site.
